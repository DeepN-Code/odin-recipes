    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
      A potato chip (often just chip, or crisp in British and Irish English) is
      a thin slice of potato that has been either deep fried or baked until
      crunchy. They are commonly served as a snack, side dish, or appetizer. The
      basic chips are cooked and salted; additional varieties are manufactured
      using various flavorings and ingredients including herbs, spices, cheeses,
      other natural flavors, artificial flavors, and additives.

        Cook in the microwave for 3 to 5 minutes, or until lightly browned (if
        not browned, they will not be crispy). Times will vary depending on the
        power of your microwave. Remove chips from plate, and toss with salt (or
        other seasonings). Let cool. Repeat process with the remaining potato
        slices. You will not need to keep oiling the plate.
